# Next.js 15 Routing Error: Route "/" has no matching routes

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications where the seemingly simple route `/` fails to match, resulting in a `'Error: Route "/" has no matching routes'` error message. The issue arises despite having a basic `pages/index.js` file in place.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new Next.js 15 app.
2. Replace the contents of `pages/index.js` with the code provided in the `bug.js` file.
3. Run the development server (`npm run dev`).
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Solution

The problem is often related to issues with the Next.js configuration, app directory structure, or conflicting middleware. The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` might involve verifying the Next.js version, checking app directory structure, or removing conflicting middleware.
